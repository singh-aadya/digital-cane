## 🎮 **Demo Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Basic Navigation**
1. Start at Main Entrance
2. Navigate to Hospital Cafeteria
3. Follow landmark-based audio instructions
4. Experience turn-by-turn guidance

### **Scenario 2: Wheelchair Accessibility**
1. Switch to Wheelchair Mode
2. Navigate from Ground Floor to 2nd Floor Consultation Room
3. System automatically uses elevator (avoiding stairs)
4. Prioritizes accessible paths with wider corridors

### **Scenario 3: Emergency Evacuation**
1. Activate Emergency Mode from any location
2. System calculates fastest route to nearest exit
3. Overrides accessibility preferences for speed
4. Provides urgent audio instructions

### **Scenario 4: Dynamic Obstacle Handling**
1. Start navigation to any destination
2. Simulate obstacle (maintenance/crowd) on active route
3. System detects blockage and recalculates route
4. Provides alternative path with explanation

### **Scenario 5: Voice Command Navigation**
1. Use voice commands: "Navigate to library"
2. System processes natural language
3. Confirms destination and begins routing
4. Responds to control commands: "repeat", "alternatives"

### **Scenario 6: Multi-Modal Experience**
1. Compare same route in different navigation modes
2. Observe how routing changes based on user needs
3. Experience different instruction styles and priorities
